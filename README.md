# Project 2
## The Card Game War

### Concepts used:
1. LANGUAGE: JS
1. Array methods
1. Indices
1. JS Math object Comparisons

### Considerations:
1. Because I was concerned about missing 2 days, I began concieving of the game without a familiarity with classes and objects. 
1. With this in mind, it occurred that I did not need to worry about the suites, just the rank in this game. 

### Process
1. Began building the basic game, and testing it running a set number of turns.
1. Created a function, called war, which I realized is just a modified general game logic. 
1. This could have allowed for a much more condensed game, as would have been the use of classes. 
1. This version is also definitely iterative programming, and not OOP. 
1. The next one will be.
